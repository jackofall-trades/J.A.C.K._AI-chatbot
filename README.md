## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get J.A.C.K. up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or Yarn (package manager)
*   MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackofall-trades/J.A.C.K._AI-chatbot.git
cd J.A.C.K.
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:

```
MONGO_URI=<Your_MongoDB_Connection_String>
JWT_SECRET=<A_Strong_Random_Secret_Key_for_JWT>
COOKIE_NAME=auth_token
OPEN_AI_SECRET=<Your_OpenAI_API_Key>
PORT=5001
```

Replace `<Your_MongoDB_Connection_String>`, `<A_Strong_Random_Secret_Key_for_JWT>`, and `<Your_OpenAI_API_Key>` with your actual values.

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5001`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal, navigate back to the root directory of the project, and then into the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd ..
cd frontend
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).
